# Global-Scope-and-Functions

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables.

Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. 
This means,  they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.
Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope.
